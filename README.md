puppet_ldapdn
=============

puppet_ldapdn is a puppet type and provider that aims to simply manage newer slapd.d style openldap entries via ldapmodify and ldapadd commands. This is much more preferable than writing files directly to the slapd.d database.

In essence the mechanism it uses is described as follows:

* Translate the puppet "ldapdn" resource into an in-memory ldif
* ldapsearch the existing dn to verify the current contents (if any)
* compare the results of the search with what should be the case
* work out which add/modify/delete commands are required to get to the desired state
* write out an appropriate ldif file
* execute it via an ldapmodify statement.

Examples of usage are as follows:

First you might like to set a root password:

```puppet
ldapdn{"add manager password":
  dn => "olcDatabase={2}bdb,cn=config",
  attributes => ["olcRootPW: password"],
  unique_attributes => ["olcRootPW"],
  ensure => present,
}
```

attributes sets the attributes that you wish to set (be sure to separate key and value with <semi-colon space>).
unique_attributes can be used to specify the behaviour of ldapmodify when there is an existing attribute with this name. If the attribute key is specified here, then the ldapmodify will issue a replace, replacing the existing value (if any), whereas if the attribute key is not specified here, then ldapmodify will simply ensure the attribute exists with the value required, alongside other values if also specified (e.g. for objectClass).

```puppet
$organizational_units = ["Groups", "People", "Programs"]
ldap::add_organizational_unit{ $organizational_units: }

define ldap::add_organizational_unit () {

  ldapdn{ "ou ${name}":
    dn => "ou=${name},dc=example,dc=com",
    attributes => [ "ou: ${name}",
                    "objectClass: organizationalUnit" ],
    unique_attributes => ["ou"],
    ensure => present,
  }

}
```

In the above example, multiple groups are created. Notice in each case, that "objectClass" does not form part of the unique_attributes, so that (in future) more objectClasses may be added to each ou, without them being replaced.

By default, all ldap commands are issued with the `-QY EXTERNAL` SASL auth mechanism. To deal with this, you might want to allow managing of the bdb database by this external mechanism, which then allows you to create a database without a "no write access to parent" error:

```puppet
ldapdn{"set general access":
  dn => "olcDatabase={2}bdb,cn=config",
  attributes => ["olcAccess: {1}to * by self write by anonymous auth by dn.base="cn=Manager,dc=example,dc=com" write by dn.base="gidNumber=0+uidNumber=0,cn=peercred,cn=external,cn=auth" manage by * read"],
  ensure => present
}
```

Here is how you can create a database in the first place:

```puppet
ldapdn{"add database":
  dn => "dc=example,dc=com",
  attributes => ["dc: example",
                 "objectClass: top",
                 "objectClass: dcObject",
                 "objectClass: organization",
                 "o: example.com"],
  unique_attributes => ["dc", "o"],
  ensure => present
}
```

Additionally, you may need to specify alternative authentication options when managing resources:

```puppet
ldapdn{"add database":
  dn => "dc=example,dc=com",
  attributes => ["dc: example",
                 "objectClass: top",
                 "objectClass: dcObject",
                 "objectClass: organization",
                 "o: example.com"],
  unique_attributes => ["dc", "o"],
  ensure => present,
  auth_opts => ["-xD", "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com", "-w", "somePassword"],
}
```

Optionally you can also now manage a remote ldap resources by adding the option remote_ldap and combining this with option auth_opts:

```puppet
  ldapdn{"adding_new_user":
    dn => "cn=users,dc=mygroup",
    attributes => ["member: cn=myteam,cn=myunit,dc=mygroup"],
    ensure => present,
    remote_ldap => "ldap1.example.com",
    auth_opts => ["-xD", "cn=admin,cn=example,dc=com", "-w", "somePassword"],
  }
```


Sometimes you will want to ensure an attribute exists, but wont care about its subsequent value. An example of this is a password.

```puppet
ldapdn{"add password":
  dn => "cn=Geoff,ou=Staff,dc=example,dc=com",
  attributes => ["olcUserPassword: {SSHA}somehash..."],
  unique_attributes => ["olcUserPassword"],
  indifferent_attributes => ["olcUserPassword"],
  ensure => present
}
```

By specifying indifferent_attributes, ensure => present will ensure that if the key doesn't exist, it will create it with the desired passwordhash, but if the key does exist, it won't bother replacing it again. In this way you can keep passwords managed by something like phpldapadmin if you so wish.

Please report any bugs, and enjoy.
